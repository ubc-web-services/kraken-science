# Badge

The badge component allows for the creation of a circular region to insert supplimental content like a count, icon or textual indicator (ie. 'New')

## Usage

This component requires some additional positioning classes as it is most commonly absolutely positioned within a relative container. These are added to the 'customClasses'. Classes for styling of the icon/text should be added to the 'styleClasses'.
